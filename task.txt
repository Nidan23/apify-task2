- Make a request to this URL that returns a JSON - https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/VuFwckCdhVhoLJJ08/items?clean=true&format=json
- You get back an array of objects in the following shape (with a random number of objects):

```json
[
    {
        "productId": "dgdgfdfg",
        "offerId": "545g43g34g",
        "price": "$4.25"
    }
]
```

Each object contains data about a single offer. `offerId` is always unique while `productId` might be same for more offers â†’ One product can have multiple offers.

- Process the data in a way that the new array will only contain the cheapest offer for each product.
- Send the data back to the same API URL from where you downloaded the data, the new array (with cheapest offers) should be send as the body/payload of the request. The format of the data should be the same.
